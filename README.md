# ESGFunds
This repository contains the data inherent to an ESG Funds analysis

This project aims at answering three questions about ESG Funds and their performance by analysing their data versus the Market data

The questions we attempted to answers are the following:

1. Are ESG Funds more volatile than the market?
2. Are ESG Funds correlated to the market?
3. Which funds are providing higher Risk Adjusted Returns?

The approach taken in this analysis is Questions to Data in order to extract Solutions or insights.

The data used in this analysis is stocks data. The funds presented in the previous section are all traded on exchange and their data is publicly available and is recorded with daily frequency. In order to carry out this operation the code gets access to the free Yahoo Finance APIs thanks to the Pandas Datareader library.
